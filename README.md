## Data Types

### Integer

```sql
INT -- Between -2 billion / +2 billion. It uses 4 bytes of Storage.
```

```sql
TINYINT -- Used for data from 0 to 255. It uses 1 bytes of Storage
```

```sql
SMALLINT -- Between -32.768 and 32.768. It uses 2 bytes of Storage
```

```sql
BIT -- It can be used in cases of two different situations. E.g. girl/boy
```

```sql
BIGINT -- Between 2^6^3 and 2⁶³. It uses 8 bytes of Storage
```

#### Float

```sql
FLOAT(size,d) -- The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. E.g. float(5,2) is 190,39.
```

#### Decimal

```sql
DECIMAL(size,d)  -- The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. E.g. Decimal(4,2) is 78,65 or Decimal(4,1) is 125,8.
```

#### String

```sql
CHAR(n) -- It is not support unicode. Used in characters of fixed length. For example, it is used in statements such as identification number and phone number. It takes up as much space as the input size, even if fewer characters are entered than specified (n). n parameter can be from 0 to 255.
```

```sql
